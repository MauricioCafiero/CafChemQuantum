# CafChemQuantum
This is a resource for an undergraduate quantum computing module. You will find both background on the quantum mechanics needed for quantum computing and a brief intro to three approaches to quantum computing:
- Q#: a C-like language developed by Microsoft
- Qiskit: a python library developed by IBM
- Cirq: a python library developed by Google.

See below for each section:
