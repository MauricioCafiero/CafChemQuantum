# CafChemQuantum
This is a resource for an undergraduate quantum computing module. You will find both background on the quantum mechanics needed for quantum computing and a brief intro to three approaches to quantum computing:
- Q#: a C-like language developed by Microsoft
- Qiskit: a python library developed by IBM
- Cirq: a python library developed by Google.

See below for each section:

- [Quantum mechanics Background](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemQuantum/blob/main/QM_background.md) topics: 
    
- [Basics of Q# and sample code](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemQuantum/blob/main/Qsharp_basics.md)

- [Basics of Qiskit and sample code](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemQuantum/blob/main/Qiskit_basics.md)

- [Basics of Cirq and sample code](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemQuantum/blob/main/Cirq_basics.md)
  
- [Quantum Machine Learning](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChemQuantum/blob/main/Qiskit_ML_CafChem.ipynb) sample code with Qiskit.
