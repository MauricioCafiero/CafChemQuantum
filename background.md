# Quantum Mechanics
## Basis states
Quantum computing is based on quantum 2-level systems. These can be spin states for nuclei (some quantum computers are NMR-based):
```
|ψ> = |up>, |down>
```
but the conventiom is to use bit notation of 1 and 0:
```
|ψ> = |0>, |1>
```
We will consider |0> as the default (or ground) state. 

## Superposition states
Before a system is measured, it can exist as 
```
|θ>
```
## Unitary transformations / Gates
